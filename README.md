# Learning about OAuth using Passport.js

This is a self-learning project created to help me understand the basics of OAuth and how to easily set it up using Passport for authenticating a user via `Google`. 

There is no special reason for choosing Google for learning. I chose it because most people have a Google account than having a GitHub or Twitter account.
